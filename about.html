        <p>Our team of six undergraduate students spanning various engineering backgrounds worked to create a data visualization to show disability in the school-to-prison pipeline. We were advised by Fathom Information Design, a company that “helps clients understand and express complex data through information graphics, interactive tools, and software for installations, the web, and mobile devices.”

        <p>However, this was by no means solely a software development project. In fact, we spent the majority of our time discussing and really trying to untangle the mess of societal factors that play into the school-to-prison pipeline’s existence, which included dives into politics, anthropology, and sociology. Our decision after months of work was to let you decide for yourself to what extent disability plays a role in the school-to-prison pipeline.

        <p>We created an interactive interface for you to explore and navigate large data sets showing suspension data across disability status, race, and geography. We hope that by presenting this data in an unbiased and easy-to-understand way, we can allow you to draw your own conclusions.

        <p>This webapp was our final project for a design course at Olin College of Engineering: Investigating Normal, taught by Sara Hendren.

        <p>“In this course, we look at medical as well as cultural tools that investigate the “normal” body and mind, and we design our own devices—high-tech, low-tech, digital or analog—with these ideas in mind. Through readings, site visits, guest speakers, and projects, we investigate both traditional and unusual prosthetics and assistive technologies, broadly defined. We talk to end-users, to engineers and industrial designers, to artists, and to others whose technologies assist with visible and invisible needs, externalize hidden dynamics, and create capacities far beyond or outside ordinary functionality.”
