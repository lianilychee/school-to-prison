                    <p>We are six undergraduate students spanning various engineering backgrounds, from software, to design, and robotics. We came together for a design course at Olin College of Engineering: Investigating Normal, to create a data visualization that tells disability’s story in the school-to-prison pipeline. We were advised by Fathom Information Design, a company that helps clients understand and express complex data through information graphics, interactive tools, and software for installations, the web, and mobile devices (<a href="http://www.fathom.io/">fathom.io</a>).</p>

                    <p>By no means was this solely a software development project. From the beginning, we aimed to put the human face of our data front and center. In fact, we spent the majority of our time untangling the messy societal factors that affect disabled minority students. After taking a deep dive into politics, anthropology, and sociology, we decided even we can’t understand the whole picture.  </p>

                    <p>This project aims to interweave the data with its context in an accessible way, to let you decide for yourself what extent disability plays a role in the school-to-prison pipeline. As you navigate our webapp, you can explore large data sets showing suspension data across disability status, race, and geography.</p>

                    </h1>

                    <p>Investigating Normal is taught by Sara Hendren(<a href="http://ablersite.org/">ablersite.org/</a>), and looks at medical as well as cultural tools that investigate the “normal” body and mind. Through readings, site visits, guest speakers, and projects, we investigate both traditional and unusual prosthetics and assistive technologies. We talk to end-users, engineers, industrial designers, artists, and any whose technologies assist with visible and invisible needs, externalize hidden dynamics, and create capacities beyond ordinary functionality. From our acquired context, we then design our own devices — high-tech, low-tech, digital or analog. </p>
