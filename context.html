When white students are sent to the office, they’re perceived as a troublemaker because they’re bored...maybe the material isn’t as engaging for them. See how those are two very different perspectives?" -Elyse </p>

                    <p class=quote>"The first step in the school to prison pipeline is when a teacher perceives a student as disruptive or defiant or having some sort of behavior problem. So the teacher will choose to send that kid out to the office with some kind of exclusionary discipline, suspension, maybe expulsion. –Elyse</p>
